  About enforcing court orders
subquestion: |
  When someone does not follow a court order from a family law case you were in, you have a few options:

  * You can go into **{mediation}**. If you are in Cook County, you may be able to use the Circuit Court's [**Family Court Services Mediation**](https://www.cookcountycourtil.gov/department/family-court-services/mediation).
  * You can file a *Petition for Rule to Show Cause* when the other party in a case is not following a court order. The petition will the court to enforce its order by finding the other party in **{contempt of court}**. You will need to include a copy of the original court order. You can only use this petition if the other party did not follow the order on purpose and did not have a good reason to do so.
  * If you need help collecting child support, you can ask the [**Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services**](https://hfs.illinois.gov/childsupport/parents/apply.html) for help.
terms:
  - "contempt of court": |
      When someone violates a court order or disrespects the court, they are in **contempt of court**.
  - "mediation": |
      When a neutral person, called a mediator, works to help the parties in a case reach an agreement. Mediation is not a court case.

id: case type
question: |
  What type of case was the order from?
subquestion: |

id: in re check
question: |
 Does the court case have the words "**In re:**" in the name?
subquestion: |
  Look at the name of the case at the top of the court papers. "In re" is often used in probate, guardianship, and some family law cases. For example, a probate case regarding Jane Doe's estate might be called "In re: Estate of Jane Doe."
  
  **Note:** If the court papers say "In re:" but also list the names of people in the case, you can select **No**. For example, if the case title is "In re: Marriage of Julia Smith and Tony Smith," the names you already entered will be put on your forms. 
fields:
  - no label: in_re_check
    datatype: yesnoradio

id: in re label
question: |
  What does it say after "**In re:**" on the court papers?

question: |
  About child support cases
subquestion: |
  Before making a petition to ask the court to enforce a child support order, you may want to contact the [**Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services**](https://hfs.illinois.gov/childsupport/parents.html). HFS may be able to help you get your child support payments.

  This program can make a petition to ask the court for to enforce a child support order, but filing a petition on your own can be harder than getting help from HFS.

  If there are visitation issues or the children are living with someone other than you, it may affect child support payments. You may want to ask a lawyer for advice. Use [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help) to find free or low-cost legal services in your area.
